	* R/bin_link.R, R/vect_link.R: Introduced several tryCatch() to
	  delete files after error
	  
	  * based on
	  http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gis.grass.stats/26
	  similar potential problems were identified and code encapsulated
	  in
	  tryCatch blocks.

	* R/vect_link.R: Backport Fix
	  http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gis.grass.stats/26
	  
	  * was reported for spgrass7 but also would apply to spgrass6

	* NAMESPACE, R/bin_link.R, R/initGRASS.R, R/spgrass6.R,
	  R/vect_link.R, man/gmeta6.Rd, man/initGRASS.Rd, man/readRAST6.Rd,
	  man/readVECT6.Rd, man/spgrass6.Rd: Add naming scheme compatible
	  with spgrass7 but keep backward compatibility
	  
	  * added aliases as followed:
	  readRAST == readRAST6
	  writeRAST == writeRAST6
	  readVECT == readVECT6
	  writeVECT6 == writeVECT6
	  gmeta6 == gmeta
	  
	  * added documentation for aliases and changed examples
	  and manual to refer to the aliases.
	  
	  * changed internal usage of these functions from the
	  function names (...6) to the new alias (without 6)
	  
	  * class returned from gmeta() is now c("gmeta", "gmeta6")
	  
	  * changed function name
	  print.gmeta6 => print.gmeta
	  
	  * Amendet manuals accordingly
	  
	  * Removed reference to getStites6 function from manual as
	  it was removed earlier.

	* R/AAA.R, R/bin_link.R, R/vect_link.R, R/xml1.R: Cleanup to remove
	  references to GRASS GIS 7
	  
	  * Remove redundant code for GRASS GIS 7.x as execution
	  of code is blocked for non 6.x GRASS GIS versions.

2015-01-28 14:16  rkrug

	* R/AAA.R, R/initGRASS.R, R/spgrass6.R: Added blocing for spgrass6
	  and spgrass7 unless correct GRASS GIS version used
	  
	  * spgrass6, spgrass: added two internal functions:
	  .grassVersion(): returns GRASS GIS version used
	  .compatibleGRASSVersion(gv=.grassVersion()): returns TRUE if
	  GRASS GIS version
	  is compatible, FALSE if not. As an attribute, it returns an error
	  / status
	  message which can be printed.
	  
	  * spgrass6/AAA.R, spgrass7/AAA.R: added check for
	  .compatibleGRASSVersion() in .onAttach()
	  which raises error if GRASS GIS version is not compatible. The
	  result is that the
	  package can not be loaded in R when running in an incompatible
	  GRASS GIS version.
	  
	  * spgrass6/initGRASS.R, spgrass7/initGRASS.R: added check for
	  .compatibleGRASSVersion()
	  which raises error if GRASS GIS version is not compatible and
	  aborts initGRASS().
